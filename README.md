# GROUP 2 PROJECT - WEATHER AND JOKE APIs
# Project Overview:
Welcome to the Weather and Joke Integrated APIs! This API provides current weather data for various locations, allowing individuals to integrate real-time weather information into their applications and also help daily users plan their daily activities efficiently. We also integrated a Joke Api into the weather Api to enable users receive a delightful joke based on the weather conditions. Whether it's hot or cold, your users can have a good laugh to cool off or warm up.
This integration combines the following features:
## FEATURES
*	Real-Time Weather Data: With a simple API call, you can fetch current weather conditions for any city location on the planet. Whether you’re building a travel app, a fitness tracker, or a local events platform, having accurate and up-to-date weather information is a must.
*	Productivity Tools: We added a “Joke” feature to the weather app to start users’ days with a smile, setting a positive tone for their tasks.
*	Integration: Integration of both Weather API and Joke API for a seamless experience.
### Getting Started with the code;
*	Clone the repository : git clone https://github.com/Mar-lim/Group_2
*	Import the required modules;
import requests # a python library to handle api interactions
import time # python library to fetch current time
*	Run the program: weather_api.py
*	Follow the prompt: Enter the desired city and declare your interest to hear a joke

# Conclusion
This project combines weather conditions and jokes to serenade its users, ease their worries and of course put smiles on their faces as they go about their day to day activities. As we know, smiling eases stress and keeps wrinkles at bay. This was the major inspiration behind the Weather and Joke Integrated APIs, which was to enable users have fun while checking the weather!
